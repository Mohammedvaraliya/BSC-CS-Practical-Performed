## Problem Statement

Creating 2D Infinite Scrolling Background.

---

**STEP 1** : Start Unity

**STEP 2 :** Create new project 2D. Add project name

**STEP 3 :** Add folders such as Sprites, Scenes, Scripts, etc

**STEP 4 :** Add Assets by right-click > Import Asset or import assets from the Unity asset store.

**STEP 5 :** Insert the assets into the scene as per your preference.

**STEP 6 :** Adjust the `MainCamera` by changing the size.

**STEP 7 :** Put the assets into their respective sorting layers. This to separate the background from the character and ground. Also add a circle collider to the main character.

> **Rigidbodies** are components that allow a GameObject to react to real-time
physics. This includes reactions to forces and gravity, mass, drag and
momentum. You can attach a Rigidbody to your GameObject by simply
clicking on Add Component and typing in Rigidbody2D in the search field.
> 

**STEP 8** : Select the platform from Hierarchy. Add a box collider from
Add component > Box Collider 2D.

**STEP 9 :** To implement the camera shake effect, add a new script to the camera.
