## Course Structure

1. **Introduction for tensorflow**
    
    With the high demand for Deep Learning, it is essential to learn about TensorFlow to create Deep Learning models. Here, we will learn what TensorFlow is, the essential library, and the in-demand skill.
    
2. **Brief About TensorFlow-2**
    
    This section will continue discussing the various functionalities of TensorFlow, including Google Colab, reasons to learn TensorFlow, and Languages & OS supported by TensorFlow.
    
3. **What are Tensors?**
    
    This section will discuss the prerequisites to understand tensors, including Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, and Python Calculus, and how they work together to provide effective results.
    
4. **How to install TensorFlow?**
    
    In this section, you will learn about the latest version and compatibility and how you can install TensorFlow based on what GUI/CLI you use for Python.
    
5. **Introduction to neural networks**
    
    You will understand what Neural Networks are and how they are a pathway to Artificial Intelligence using Deep Learning. This section will also give a brief idea of weights & mathematics in Neural Networks.
    
6. **Getting Started with TensorFlow**
    
    In this section, you will understand what a Tensor looks like, how it works, how we can programmatically write the Tensor, and how to get it to perform operations for us eventually.
    
7. **Basic Demo on TensorFlow-2**
    
    You will learn about the new version- of TensorFlow 2.x, its features, and what's new in this version.
    
8. **Linear Regression Using TensorFlow-2**
    
    This section will throw light on how to perform Linear Regression using TensorFlow using different linear equations with step-by-step explanations.
    
9. **Demo #1: MNIST Character Recognition with TensorFlow**
    
    This will be a hands-on session discussing 2 use cases: Digit classification using the MNIST dataset & image classification using CNN. This chapter will talk about the former demo.
    
10. **Demo #2: Binary classifier using Convolutional Neural Network**
    
    In this section, you will get clarity on what CCN is and then go on to solve the demo use case.
    
11. **Getting Started with Keras-2**
    
    Learn about the various features of Keras, Keras Vs. tf.keras, and then we will look at the code snippets to have a better understanding.
